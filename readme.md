### Introduction

The HMD-Storefront project is a web-based storefront application built using modern technologies such as React, Neo4J, and Node.js. The goal is to provide to small businesses a free/open/locally connected platform to sell their products and services, gather data and insights, and connect with their customers just as well as the big guys.


### Features

- Check-in system for customers loyalty
- User authentication and registration locally
- Graph analytics for sales and customer behavior
- Easy to use on pc and mobile
- Soon: Payment integration with popular payment gateways, including DeFi and Crypto
- Soon: Better visualizations and insights for business owners
- Goal: Interconnectivity with other local businesses and services to grow the local ecosystem away from big tech.


### Getting Started

No idea yet how to really package this together (will soon though!), but to get started with the HMD-Storefront project, you will need a Neo4J Desktop instance running on your local machine. You can download Neo4J Desktop from the [official website](https://neo4j.com/download/). From there, you will set up the database and add your password to server.mjs. After, you should be set! Still working on the authentication and other systems built for Neo4J, but basic loyalty functionality is working ^_^.

To get started with the HMD-Storefront project front-end, I will eventually package it all together, but follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/hmd-storefront.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Ensure Neo4J is running, connected correctly in your server.mjs file.
4. Start the application: `npm run dev`. This is my dev script that opens both the front-end and back-end server to Neo4J.

### Contributing

The point of this was decentralization of commerce, so I would love to see people contribute to this project. If you have any ideas, suggestions, or improvements, please feel free to contribute!
